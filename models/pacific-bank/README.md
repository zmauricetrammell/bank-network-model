# Notional "Pacific Bank" – Network Model

This model represents a hypothetical but realistic enterprise banking network based on publicly observable characteristics and standard financial industry practices.

The goal is not to replicate any proprietary architecture, but to practice:
- Translating regulatory and business requirements into network design
- Modeling centralized security and branch connectivity
- Evaluating segmentation, routing, and failure behavior
- Preparing the environment for future automation

All assumptions are explicitly documented and treated as adjustable.
