# Modeling Assumptions

All models in this repository are based on assumptions derived from:
- Public information
- Industry norms
- Observational reasoning
- Interview-style requirement gathering

Assumptions are:
- Explicit
- Revisable
- Used to drive design decisions

Incorrect assumptions are treated as learning opportunities, not failures.
