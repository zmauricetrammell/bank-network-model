# Enterprise Network Models

This repository contains realistic network models and lab simulations derived from real-world business scenarios.

The focus is on:
- Infrastructure design driven by business and regulatory requirements
- Security-first network segmentation
- Centralized vs edge decision-making
- Repeatable, auditable changes
- Preparing designs for automation and infrastructure-as-code

Each model begins with a business interview and assumptions, followed by:
- A current-state ("as-is") network model
- Iterative improvements toward a secure, resilient target state
- GNS3-based lab implementations to validate behavior

This repository is intentionally structured to reflect how enterprise networks are designed and evolved in practice.
